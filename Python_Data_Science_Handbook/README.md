## Reading status (27/11/2022)

The important parts I wanted to read in this book were the ones about numpy, pandas
and matplotlib. For ML stuff, because I don't really need it at the moment, and because
the only models I sometimes work on are CNN, I use tensorflow / pytorch, which is
not described in this book. For these reasons, I'm done with this book.
