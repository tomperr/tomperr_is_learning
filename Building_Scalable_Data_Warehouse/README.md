## Reading status (27/11/2022)

I needed to read the important parts of this book for a project at University of
Birmingham ("Storing and Managing Data" module). I took notes on first chapters, as
they are (from my pov) the most important ones. However, I also spent some times
digging into the other chapters, but as it was way less useful for me, I did not
feel the need to keep a trace of everything. As the project I needed to work on
is done, so is this book.

*If you are one of my teacher at UoB, who found this repo by searching the name
of the module on GitHub, I just wanted to let you know that Data Vault is DOPE,
but that the project was a complete mess (because some stuff about Data Vault on the
subject were completely wrong).*
