Well, I don't totally agree with this guy, but meh, seems like I still have things to learn.


## Roadmap / To read

| Resource Name     | Tags   | Status     | Comment   |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Python Data Science Handbook | Python, Data Science | Reading | To learn Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib... |
| Building Scalable Data Warehouse | Data Science, Storing, Data Vault | Reading | Data Vault 2.0 seems DOPE |
| Effective Modern C++ | C++, C++11, C++14 | To read | Yes, C++20 has been released, I know, but I need to catch up previous versions before. Even if Python > all, I need to learn C++ tricky stuff for next job (see you February 2023) |
