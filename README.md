Well, I don't totally agree with this guy, but meh, seems like I still have things to learn.


## Roadmap / To read

| Resource Name     | Tags   | Status     | Comment   |
|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| [Python Data Science Handbook](./Python_Data_Science_Handbook/README.md) | Python, Data Science | Done | To learn Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib... |
| [Building Scalable Data Warehouse](./Building_Scalable_Data_Warehouse/README.md) | Data Science, Storing, Data Vault | Done | Data Vault 2.0 seems DOPE |
| Effective Modern C++ | C++, C++11, C++14 | To read | Yes, C++20 has been released, I know, but I need to catch up previous versions before. Even if Python > all, I need to learn C++ tricky stuff for next job (see you February 2023) |
